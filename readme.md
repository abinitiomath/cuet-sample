I started my CUET preparation in March 2024. This is also when I created a deck for Business Studies and Economics. 
Over the next 2.5 months, I created about 1100 flashcards. These include questions I crafted myself, PYQs, and Mocks.
I've attached a PDF file that contains original sample questions.
I think the next level in any exam preparation is inclusion of automated spaced repetition in the exam prep strategy. 
I found Anki to be quite useful for this. 
In 2.5 months, I did 12000+ reviews and went from getting a 105 in my BST mock to getting consistent 200s by mid-april.
